# FriskWatch

## Overview
FriskWatch is a Java program designed to analyze stop-and-frisk data provided by the New York Police Department (NYPD). This program reads stop-and-frisk records from a CSV file, processes the data, and provides analysis to compare occurrences during and after the policy implementation. It leverages advanced data structures and algorithms to manage and analyze the data efficiently.
